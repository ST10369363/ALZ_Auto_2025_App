Introduction 
AL'Z Auto, an auto mechanic workshop, has partnered with PGA IT Solutions to develop a web and mobile application aimed at modernizing its operations. The project focuses on automating and streamlining key processes such as car service bookings, payments, and customer management. This solution is expected to enhance the workshop's efficiency, improve customer experience, and provide transparency in operations. By automating service reservations and payments, lowering human error, and guaranteeing quicker return times, the project seeks to increase efficiency.  By offering a user-friendly platform for handling reservations, payments, and vehicle-related data, it also seeks to improve the client experience.  By offering real-time data on repairs, payment history, and service status, the platform will also guarantee transparency.
